# Module 2 overview

## Markets

This module will span over approximately 2 weeks. During the first week, we will cover the foundations of financial markets. In the second week, we will focus on behavioural finance, which is the study of how human decisions can drive market anomalies that would not be predicted by standard economic approaches to markets.

By the end of this module,  you will be able to answer the following questions:

    1. What is a financial market?
    2. What is the efficient markets hypothesis?
    3. What are some common anomalies observed in financial markets?
    4. What are some behavioural explanations for these anomalies?
