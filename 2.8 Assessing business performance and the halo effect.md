# 2.8 Assessing business performance and the halo effect

In a paper in 1920, Edward Thorndike described his research into how superiors rated officers under their command. He found that the ratings of each person for traits such as intelligence, leadership and physical qualities were highly correlated. He suggested that the people giving these ratings were unable to analyse each specific trait for each person, so based the ratings on a general impression of the person as good or inferior. The ratings of each trait were suffused with a "halo" belonging to the individual as a whole.

Following Thorndike, this tendency to make inferences about specific traits based on a general impression is often labelled the "halo effect". 

The result of this difficulty is that people tend to allow good performance in the areas that they can measure (such as profits) to contaminate their assessment of other company attributes. They endow the company with a halo.

This tendency has implications for corporate decision making. When a researcher asks people to rate company attributes when they know the business outcome, those ratings are contaminated. If profits are up, people will assign positive attributes to that company. If times are bad, they will assign negative attributes. As for Cisco, all the factors responsible for a company's rise might suddenly became the reasons for the fall, or be claimed to have never existed in the first place.

As an example, for many years Apple has had a clean sweep of all nine attributes in Fortune's "World's Most Admired Companies](https://fortune.com/worlds-most-admired-companies/2020/apple/)" poll. It is rated one in social responsibility, long-term investment value, innovation, people management and product quality. Is there not a single company in the world that is better than Apple on any of these nine? When asked nine questions, people don't have nine different opinions. They just give their general impression nine times.

Understanding the halo effect is important when reading any book or article examining corporate performance. We need to ask whether the researchers designed the data collection such that their knowledge of the firm's performance does not contaminate all that they do.
