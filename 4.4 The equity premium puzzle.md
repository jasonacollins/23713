# 4.4 The equity premium puzzle

The equity premium is the gap between the expected return on the stock market versus a portfolio of fixed-income securities (e.g. bonds). Since 1926 the annual real return for stocks in the United States has been about 7%, while the real return on Treasury bills has been less than 1%. (A Treasury bill is a  short-period bond, issued by the United States Treasury, that pays a face value at maturity. They are bought at a discount to the face value to create a positive yield.)

This difference in yield might appear to be justifiable by the greater riskiness of stocks. If stocks are riskier, they should earn higher returns.

However, Mehra and Prescott (1985) examined this premium and argued that the size of the premium would require an implausible level of risk aversion. A reasonable level of risk aversion would result in an equity premium of around 0.1%. The size of the observed premium is hence a puzzle.

## Behavioural explanations

One behavioural explanations for the equity premium puzzle is ambiguity aversion, a preference for known risks over unknown risks. People don't just not know what the return will be. They also don't know what the potential distribution of returns is. They therefore require a greater premium for stocks than would be expected from risk aversion alone.
