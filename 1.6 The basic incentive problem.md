# 1.6 The basic incentive problem

The basic incentive problem is related to the issue of organisational design and the allocation of decision rights we have already discussed. There is an agency problem created by delegating decision rights. The interests of the owners and employees are not always aligned. More generally, the interest of principals and agents is not generally aligned.

This misalignment creates a challenge in designing incentives to align those interests. Below are two illustrations of this challenge, one narrative and the other mathematical. You won't be asked to replicate the math, but you may find that it will assist your understanding of the scenario.

## A narrative exploration

The owner of Acme Corporation wants her employees to put in higher effort and work diligently. However, her employee Ian, while he likes to be paid, doesn't like to put in effort. As his income goes up, he's happier, but he's also happier the more he can lounge around in the office and cruise Facebook.

Ian won't get out of bed and turn up to work for less than $1,000 a week. That is what we call his reservation wage. He then needs to be paid for his efforts in the office. He has a mentally taxing job, so each hour of effort is harder than the last. As a result, he will demand a salary of at least $1000 plus a compensating amount for whatever level of effort he provides.

The firm benefits from Ian's effort, receiving around $100 for every hour that he applies himself.

If they could tell whether Ian was working or not, they could just agree a level of effort, pay him an agreed sum for it, and then monitor to make sure he delivers. What is that sum?

The firm will want to pay Ian the sum that maximises its profit. Ian wants to set his level of effort such that he balances his desire for income and that increasing cost of effort. As the firm receives $100 for every hour he works, they will pay Ian up to the point where he demands more than $100 for each additional hour that he works.

Putting this into classical economic terms, the *marginal benefit* to the firm of each hour that Ian works is $100. Their profit will be maximised when that marginal benefit is equal to the *marginal cost* of inducing an additional hour of effort out of Ian. The firm could pay him more to get even more effort and output, but the cost of inducing this effort would exceed the benefit they receive.

## A mathematical exploration

Ian's utility (*U*) is a function of his income (*I*) and his effort (*e*, the hours actually spent working). Utility is increasing in income (+ve) and decreasing (-ve) in effort. Let:

$U(I,e)=i-e^2$

Ian's reservation wage is $1,000.

For the firm, they get $100 of output for every hour Ian works:

$B=\$100e$

Assume that effort is observable at zero cost and it is verifiable. It is possible to contract over effort. In this case, the firm will offer Ian a contract requiring he puts in a specified level of effort $\hat e$.

The contract will be acceptable to Ian if he receives at least his reservation level of utility. That is, the contract will be acceptable as long as it pays: 

$\\\$(1000+\hat e^2)$

If Ian accepts the contract he gets:

$U(.)=1000+\hat e^2-\hat e^2=1000$

The firm's challenge is to maximise profit ($\pi$). That is:

$max\:\pi_e=\$100\hat e-[\$1000+\hat e^2]$

First Order Condition (the derivative of the profit function equals zero at the maximum): $\:100-2\hat e=0$    
So the profit maximising level of effort is: $e^*=50$    
$Payment = 1000+\hat e^2=1000+2500=3500$    
$\pi=50(1000)-3500=1500$

At effort level $\hat e=50$, the marginal benefit of higher effort is equal to Ian's marginal cost of inducing higher effort. This can be seen in the diagram.

## Limitations

What are the limitations to this story?

For one, Ian's effort is usually not costlessly observable by the firm. They can't simply contract to deliver a set amount of effort.

Why can't the firm just look at output?

It may be difficult to measure. Even if it was measurable, it may not reflect effort. It's likely that there are other effects on output besides Ian's effort.

## Three lessons

There are three lessons that we can draw:    
a) Incentive problems exist because the interests of the  employer and the employee diverge. This is known as the principal-agent problem.    
b) Incentive conflicts do not cause problems when effort is contractible. The employer can simply specified the appropriate level of effort for which a bonus is payable.    
c) In choosing the optimal action the costs to the employee from higher effort and the benefits to the firm in terms of higher profits need to be balanced.
