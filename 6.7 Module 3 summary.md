# Module 3 summary

## Module 3: Better decisions

In this module, we have covered several different ways to improve corporate decisions, including the use of models, the development of expertise, improved group decision making structures, and forecasting techniques. You're done.

If you want a bit more, here's a podcast where Robert Wiblin interviews Philip Tetlock on the 80,000 hours podcast. I recommend (optionally) listening to it as they touch on a lot of topics from the unit.
