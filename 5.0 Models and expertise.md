# 5 Models and expertise

Two standard tools for improving decision making are the use of models or data, and the development of expertise.

A **model** is a mathematical construct representing the process of interest, made up of a set of variables and the mathematical relationships between them. A model can be used to predict future or unseen outcomes.

An example of a model we discussed earlier in this unit involved predicting the level of drop out in a school using variables such as attendance rates, family socio-economic status, the school's average SAT score, and the degree of parental involvement in the child's schooling. This set of variables could be input into the model to give an output of the predicted level of drop out.

A model is typically developed using a set of observations for which we know both the input and output variables. (This is often called the training data set.) We then use the model to predict the outcome for a new observation where we know the input variables but not the outcome of interest.

**Expertise** is the development of deep domain knowledge that enables the expert to apply more effective strategies, form rich mental models, and have highly organised domain knowledge. Under certain conditions, this can lead to more effective decision making.

Despite pre-dating the behavioural literature, these two approaches can provide an antidote to some of the poor decisions that we have examined so far in this course.
