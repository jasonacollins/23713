# Text for intro speech

Through March 2020, as the extent and consequences of the coronavirus pandemic became clear, the share price of Zoom Technologies skyrocketed. In the span of a month, the stock soared from around $3 to more than $20.

This does not seem strange given the sudden surge in videoconferencing as people were prevented from travelling and forced to work from home. But there was one problem. Zoom Technologies, with it's stock ticker "ZOOM" on the NASDAQ, is not the videoconferencing company. That company is Zoom Video Communications, with it's stock ticker symbol "ZM". It is not even clear what Zoom Technologies does. Zoom Technologies had made no public disclosure of any type since 2015. People had driven a near seven-fold increase in the price of Zoom Technologies through an error.

One of the foundational ideas in finance is the efficient markets hypothesis. If markets are efficient, then asset prices should reflect all available information. They should reflect their fundamental value, the discounted flow of payments an asset willl entitle the owner to in the future.

This simple story of Zoom Technologies is an anomoly, a departure from the behaviour we would expect under the efficient markets hypothesis. It's stock price reacted strongly to irrelevant information. To information that should have had no effect on its fundamental value.

Anomolies such as this form the evidentiary backbone of the field of behavioural finance. But why do anomalies such as this emerge?

As you have learned through this course to date, humans are not perfect decision makers that conform to the economic assumptions of rationality. We use rules of thumb, or heuristics, in our decision making. We have limited cognitive capacity, attention and self-control. We make errors. 

These features of human decision making do not only have implications for individuals. They affect the decisions and behaviour of corporations, one of the central actors in the economy. Overconfidence, bounded awareness and our use of heuristics can lead to poor decisions in areas ranging from recruitment to merger and acquisitions.

The nature of human decisision making also affects the behaviour of markets, where we see the aggregation of many individual decisions. Markets appear to be overly volatile, have lagged reactions or momentum, and produce price bubbles with no apparent foundation.

In this unit, Behavioural Economics and Corporate Decision Making, I will take you inside these firms and markets to understand what happens when we bring human decision makers together. We will explore where corporate decision making can go wrong. We will examine whether markets are truly efficient, and if the price is always right.

Thankfully, in a world of poor corporate decisions and inefficient markets, we can access tools and techniques to improve our decision making. In this unit we will also explore how data, models, debiasing, nudging and expertise can improve corporate and market decisions.
