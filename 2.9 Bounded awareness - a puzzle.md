# 2.9 Bounded awareness - a puzzle

You represent Company A (the potential acquirer), which is  considering acquiring Company T (the target) by means of a tender offer.

The value of Company T depends on the outcome of a major oil exploration project that it is currently undertaking. If the project fails, the company under current management will be worth nothing ($0 per share). But if the project succeeds, the value of the company under current management could be as high as $100 per share. All share values between $0 and $100 are considered equally likely.

However, Company T will be worth more in the hands of Company A than under current management. In fact, the company will be worth 50 percent more under the management of A than under the management of Company T. If the project fails, the company will be worth $0 per share under either management. If the exploration project generates a $50 per share value under current management, the value under Company A will be $75 per share. Similarly, a $100 per share value under Company T implies a $150 per share value under Company A, and so on. It should be noted that the only possible option to be considered is paying in cash for acquiring 100% of Company T’s shares. This means that if you acquire Company T, its current management will no longer have any shares in the company, and therefore will not benefit in any way from the increase in its value under your management.

The board of directors of Company A has asked you to determine whether or not to submit an offer for acquiring company T’s shares, and if so, what price they should offer for these shares. This offer must be made before the outcome of the drilling project is known. Company T will accept any offer from Company A, provided it is at a profitable price for
them. It is also clear that Company T will delay its decision to accept or reject your bid until the results of the drilling project are in. Thus you (Company A) will not know the results of the exploration project when submitting your price offer, but Company T will know the results when deciding on your offer. As already explained, Company T is expected to accept any offer by Company A that is greater than the (per share) value of the company under current management, and to reject any offers that are below or equal to this value. Thus, if you offer $60  per share, for example, Company T will accept if the value under current management is anything less than $60.

As the representative of Company A, you are deliberating over price offers in the range of $0  per share (this is equivalent to making no offer at all) to $150 per share. What price offer per share would you tender for Company T's stock?
