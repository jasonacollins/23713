In this unit we apply the insights from behavioural economics to understand dynamics within firms, how firms and their agents make decisions, and what pitfalls may exist in organisational decision making processes. We will also examine how real markets function when these markets are the result of the actions of consumers, managers and investors as modelled by behavioural economics.

The unit is organised into three main modules:

- **Module 1 - Corporate decision making**: Why do firms exists? How do firms make decisions? What drives a firm's organisational architecture? What are some common failings of corporate decision making?
- **Module 2 - Financial Markets**: What happens when firms and individuals interact in markets? Where does market behaviour depart from that expected by traditional economic theory? What are some explanations for these departures?
- **Module 3 - Better decisions**: What tools do we have to improve corporate decision making? How can we use models, expertise, nudging or debiasing?
