# 2.12 Incentives in the workplace

In the first part of this module we considered how the principal can motivate their agent employee. That employee balances the marginal cost of their effort against the marginal benefit of the return to their effort.

However, experimental evidence shows that this picture of motivation is incomplete.

## Experiment 1

The experimental participants were provided with financial incentives to undertake a series of tasks that required creativity, concentration, memory and problem solving skills. Some participants could earn a bonus equivalent to about one day's pay. Others could earn a medium sized bonus equivalent to about two weeks pay. And a third group could earn a bonus worth around five months of their regular pay. (The experiment was done in rural India, so although the amounts were relatively large for the participants, they did not break the experimental budget.)

The result was that those who received the small or medium level bonus did not differ much from each other in performance. But those who had a large bonus on the line were the poorest performers. They choked under pressure.

## Experiment 2

Daniel Hedblom, Brent Hickman and John List created their own firm and hired actual workers to perform data entry tasks. Some workers were told about the firm's corporate social responsibility in the job advertisement.

When advertised as socially orientated, the advertisements attracted workers who were more productive and produced higher quality work. This effect was driven by both a selection effect, in that it attracted a slightly different pool of workers, and a treatment effect on the workers in that it made them more productive. The social advertising also increased the number of applicants by 25%, which was the equivalent effect of increasing wages by 36%.

## Experiment 3

John List and Fatmeh Momeni hired workers on Amazon's online labour market platform, Amazon Mechanical Turk, and asked them to complete a short task for payment. They were then exposed to various corporate social responsibility messages.

List and Momeni found that the use of corporate social responsibility messaging increased cheating - both the number of workers who shirk their primary job duty and the level of the shirking. The share of cheating was highest when the corporate social responsibility message was framed as a prosocial act on behalf of workers.

This cheating is consistent with a higher level of "moral licensing", whereby good behaviour in one domain liberates us to behave unethically in another while maintaining our self-image as a good and moral person.

## Experiment 4

Workers in a semi-conductor plant in Israel were sent a message on day one of their four-day work stretch offering one of the following incentives if they met their target for the day:

- A $30 bonus
- A pizza voucher
- A thank you text message from the boss
- No message (the control group)

For people who were offered one of the three incentives, there was a boost to productivity on that day relative to the control: 4.9% for the cash group, 6.7% for the pizza group, and 6.6% for the thank you group.

The more interesting result was over the next three days. On day two, the group that had been incentivised with cash on day one had their productivity drop to 13.2% less than the control group. Absent the cash reward, they took their foot off the gas. On day three productivity was 6.2% worse. And on day four it was 2.9% worse. Over the four days, the productivity of the cash incentive group was 6.5% below that of the control. In contrast, the thank you group had no crash in productivity, with the pizza group somewhere in between. The cash reward on day one, but not the other days, had sent a signal that day one was the only day when production mattered. Or the cash reward displaced some other form of motivation.

## Experiment 5

Uri Gneezy and John List hired experimental participants to perform either data entry to computerise the holdings of a small library, or to undertake door-to-door fundraising. The advertisement for the position included the hourly rate they would be paid for the six hours of work, $12 and $10 per hour for the two roles respectively.

In both cases, a treatment group of employees was then told at the beginning of their employment that they would be paid a higher hourly rate of $20. The employees doing data entry boosted their effort in response markedly over the first 90 minutes, after which their effort became indistinguishable from those still paid $12 per hour. Similarly, the fundraisers who received the surprise pay increase raised much more money in the first few hours of the task, but after that were indistinguishable from those still paid $10 per hour.
