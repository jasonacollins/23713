# 4.5 Loss aversion and the equity premium puzzle

The questions you have just answered relate to a famous exchange between Paul Samuelson and some lunch colleagues. Samuelson offered them a $200 to $100 bet that the side of a coin they specified would not appear at the first toss. One of the colleagues responded:

>I won’t bet because I would feel the $100 loss more than the $200 gain. But I'll take you on if you promise to let me make 100 such bets.

This response captures the intuition behind loss aversion.

Samuelson showed that this set of choices was not consistent with expected utility theory. He then suggested that his colleague, if truly an expected utility maximiser, was making a mistake in accepting the bet of 100 flips given they refused the single flip. This is despite the fact that the sequence of 100 flips has an expected return of $5 000, with less than a 0.05% chance of losing any money, and less than a 0.002% chance of losing more than $1000.

But what if a person is not an expected utility maximiser, but rather is loss averse. Suppose they have the following utility function:

$U(x)=\begin{cases}
x & x \geq 0\\
2.5x & x <0
\end{cases}$

where *x* is a change in wealth relative to the status quo.

This person will turn down a 50:50 bet to win $200, lose $100 (their expected utility is -50 with our loss averse utility function). However, they would accept a sequence of two such bets, which has a distribution of outcomes of a 25% chance of winning $400, a 50% chance of winning $100 and a 25% chance of losing $200 (expected utility of 25). Any longer sequence of bets has even higher positive utility.

Note, however, that this positive utility for a sequence of bets only occurs if they do not have to watch the sequence of bets being played out. If they had to watch each consecutive flip, they would reject the bet as every individual flip has negative expected utility.

## Explaining the equity premium puzzle

This story captures the intuition behind Benartzi and Thaler's  (1995) explanation of the equity premium puzzle.

Suppose an investor has a choice between risky stocks, with an expected annual return of 7% and standard deviation of 20%, and a sure return of 1%. Like Samuelson's bet, the attractiveness of stocks to a loss averse investor will depend on both the time horizon of the investor and the frequency with which they evaluate the returns. If they monitor their portfolio frequently, they will often observe losses from stocks, which they feel with greater force than gains.

Suppose that one loss averse investor examines their portfolio every day. Since on a daily basis stocks go down almost as often as they go up, this investor will experience a lot of pain, making the stocks unattractive. Another loss averse investor only checks in on their portfolio once a decade. At that horizon, stocks have only a small probability of losing money, so will be much more attractive to someone who is loss averse.

It is a combination of loss aversion and a short evaluation period that will drive an investor to require a large premium for holding the risky option. Benartzi and Thaler call this *myopic loss aversion*.
