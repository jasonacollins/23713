## 1.3 Contracting costs and the existence of firms

The classic answer to the question of why firms exist came from another Nobel Memorial Prize recipient, Ronald Coase. His idea was that contracting costs explain the existence of the firm. Firms incur search costs, bargaining costs, decision costs, monitoring costs and enforcement costs in any economic transaction. There is also an opportunity cost if the transaction results in an inefficient allocation of resources. The optimal method of organisation is the one that minimises contracting costs.

This provides a basis for economic activity occurring both within firms and markets. Contracting costs may make organisation into firms the more efficient mode of exchange for some forms of transactions. Rather than having to specify every detail into a myriad of contracts, people can become employees with more scope to vary in their actions and duties as required.

Conversely, where the inefficient allocation of resources outweigh the contracting costs, the optimal method will be market exchange.

This division between firms and markets can also be blurred. Firms may use pricing systems inside to allocate resources. For example, teams may be required to work on a consulting model. Those who use them will be charged against their internal budget.
