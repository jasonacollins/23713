# 4.1 Lagged reactions to announcements

As noted earlier, the first papers to use event studies to examine market efficiency typically found evidence consistent with the market being efficient. However, since those early studies, improved methodologies and data have resulted in a steady increase in the evidence against market efficiency.

One example of a study questioning market efficiency was by Richard Rendleman and friends (1982), who examined data around quarterly earnings announcements for around 1000 firms between 1972 and 1980. For each announcement they determined the extent to which the actual earnings varied from the forecast earning per share.

Unsurprisingly, they found that the market responds positively to positive surprises and negatively to negative surprises. That is consistent with the efficient markets hypothesis.

However, they also found continual drift in prices following the announcement, particularly announcements that involved a large surprise on either the upside or downside. This is inconsistent with market efficiency. It suggest either an under-reaction to the announcement, with the full reaction delayed, or an over-reaction in the long-term.

## A behavioural explanation

One possible explanation for under-reaction followed by post-announcement drift is *anchoring*. Investors anchor on previous earnings announcements, meaning that they under-react to new information contained in the announcement.
