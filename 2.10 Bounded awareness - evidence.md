What do people offer to acquire the company?

When this problem is given to MBA students, CEOs, investment bankers and other skilled groups, the dominant responses tend to be between $50 and $75 per share. A typical explanation is that the average outcome for company T is $50, making the value for company A $75. Any offer in the range between these two values would be agreeable for both parties.

But let's think through a specific number. 

What if we made an offer of $60? If we make an offer of $60 it will be accepted 60% of the time - whenever the firm is worth between $0 and $60 for company T. Since all those values are equally likely, the firm will be worth on average $30 to company T when they accept, meaning it will be worth $45 on average for company A. A $60 offer will result in an average loss of $15.

Generalising this, any offer of $X that is accepted will have an expected value of $X/2 for firm A. The expected value is therefore 1.5($X/2)=0.75($X). For any positive value offer, we can see that any offer above $0 generates a negative expected return, a loss of 25% of the offer.

The analytical logic here is not difficult. But most people do not initially see it. Typically less than 10% of respondents offer $0. People systematically exclude information from their decision making process that they have the ability to include. They fail to see that their expected return depends on acceptance by the other party, which is subject to the true value which only they know. Acceptance is most likely to occur when the value is lower.
