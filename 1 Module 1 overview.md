# Module 1 overview

## Corporate decision making

This module will span over approximately 2 weeks. During the first week, we will cover the foundations of corporate decision making. The second week, we will focus on how corporate decision making can fail and what features of human decision making can drive this failure. 

By the end of this module,  you will be able to answer the following questions:

1. Why do firms exist?
2. How do firms make decisions?
3. What drives a firm's organisational architecture?
4. What are some common failings of corporate decision making? 

## 10 questions

Throughout this first half of this module, you will be asked to answer 10 questions. They are just for fun and to illustrate some later material.

For each question, provide an upper bound and a lower bound that forms a 90% confidence interval for your answer. In other words, there should be only a 5% chance that the true answer is below your lower bound (95% chance it is above) and a 5% chance that the true answer is above your upper bound (95% chance it is below). Do not research the answer.Â  If you have very little concept of the answer, adjust your confidence intervals accordingly.

As an example, suppose I was asked the height of Mount Everest. I might guess a lower bound of 8500m, and an upper bound of 9000m. I should choose this bound so that I believe the true height has a 90% probability of being within those two bounds.

Start with the question below and proceed with answering the questions on the following pages.

    Quiz 1: What is the average orbital difference of the moon from the earth (in kilometres)? Post your lower and upper bound forming a 90% confidence interval in the box below.
