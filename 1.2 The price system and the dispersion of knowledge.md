# 1.2 The price system and the dispersion of knowledge

There is much evidence that the price system is more efficient at controlling and coordinating production and consumption decisions than central planning. Market economies are characterised by the production of goods valued by consumers while avoiding large shortages. Planned economies such as the former Soviet Union are characterised by poor customer choice, shortages and other production mistakes.

Two of the reasons why this is the case are:

- The price system motivates better use of knowledge and information in decision making
- It provides stronger incentives to make productive decisions

## The dispersion of knowledge

Think about some of the knowledge that might be critical in allocating resources in a firm. 

- Idiosyncratic knowledge: Knowledge about the skills or preferences of staff, the characteristics of particular machines, the presence of unemployed resources (such as the fact there is space in the back of the truck)
- Scientific knowledge: The knowledge how to make a silicon graphics processing unit. Even if readily available, it is not easily transferred to those without technical skills
- Assembled knowledge: A storekeeper who has worked in a local store for years will have assembled a unique body of knowledge about the needs of local customers, and the local suppliers.

The knowledge for decision making is not held by any one individual. It is distributed across people in the economy.

This specific knowledge is critical in properly allocating resources, yet it is costly to transfer. It can be impossible to aggregate for a central decision maker. Even if it could be aggregated, it would require massive mental ability or computing power to process it.

In a market economy, the decentralised holders of the specific information make the decisions. They do not need to transfer their knowledge somewhere else, but can act on it themselves.

What coordinates these decentralised decision makers are prices. Prices create an economical way of effectively transferring information to coordinate decisions.
