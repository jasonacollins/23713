# 6.5 Incentives

Much of the behavioural literature rests on experiments with low or no stakes. This is somewhat different from that experienced in corporate decision making, where stakes for both the individual and firm can be large.

There is a dearth of evidence of whether cognitive biases are directly reduced in a high-stakes corporate environment. More generally, there is a general lack of high-stakes experiments, with most direct examinations of incentives being an investigation into the difference between no and small stakes.

An exception is a recent working paper by Benjamin Enke and friends (2020), which examined the effect of high stakes on base rate neglect, anchoring, the failure of contingent thinking, and intuitive reasoning.

You have come across base rate neglect (in the context of the outside view) and anchoring earlier in this unit. The test of intuitive reasoning used the cognitive reflection test, with the following two questions:

> 1. A bat and a ball cost 110 KSh in total. The bat costs 100 KSh more than the ball. How much does the ball cost?(Intuitive answer is 10, correct answer is 5).
>
> 2. It takes 5 nurses 5 minutes to measure the blood pressure of 5 patients. How long would it take 10 nurses to measure the blood pressure of 10 patients?(Intuitive answer is 10, correct answer is 5).

(The currency is KSh as this work was done in Kenya.)

The test of contingent reasoning used the Wason selection task. One version used in the experiment runs as follows:

> Suppose you have a friend who says he has a special deck of cards. His special deck of cards all have numbers (odd or even) on one side and colors (brown or green) on the other side. Suppose that the 4 cards from his deck are shown below. Your friend also claims that in his special deck of cards, even numbered cards are never brown on the other side. He says: “In my deck of cards, all of the cards with an even number on one side are green on the other.”
> 
> Unfortunately, your friend doesn’t always tell the truth, and your job is to figure out whether he is telling the truth or lying about his statement. From the cards below, turn over only those card(s) that can be helpful in determining whether your friend is telling the truth or lying. Do not turn over those cards that cannot help you in determining whether he is telling the truth or lying. Select the card(s) you want to turn over.

Which cards would you turn over?

(I am showing some of the particular tests here not because they are vital to the question of incentives, but rather that these tests appear again and again in the behavioural literature. It is worth becoming familiar with them.)

The headline of the experiment was that the large stakes did little to reduce the bias of the experimental participants, with the exception of the cognitive reflection test. Response times increased by around 40% with the large stakes, suggesting that the performance increase comes from a reduction in the reliance on intuitions.

As for why the experimental participants did  not do better, the paper authors write that "some problems are sufficiently complex for people that the binding constraint is not low effort and reliance on intuitions but instead a lack of conceptual problem solving skills"
