# 6 Nudging and debiasing

Over the last decade, an increasing range of methods have been developed to change the decision making and behaviour of people using concepts for behavioural science. 

In this second half of this module on better decisions, we sample a selection of these. This includes the use of groups in decision making, how to develop better forecasts, and the use of incentives. We also examine one particular application: how to debias recruitment.
