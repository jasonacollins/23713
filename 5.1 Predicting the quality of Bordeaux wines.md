# 5.1 Predicting the quality of Bordeaux wines

Wine has been produced in the Bordeaux region of France since the Romans planted the first vineyards there almost 2000 years ago. Today, Bordeaux is famous for its red wine, and it’s the source of some of the most expensive wine in the world.

Yet the quality and price of that wine varies considerably from year to year. So each year the questioned is asked. Will this vintage be a classic, like the great 1961? Or will it be more like the disappointing vintage of 1960?

To answer those questions, four months after a new Bordeaux vintage is barrelled, the experts take their first taste. This early in its life, the immature wine tastes like swill. The wine is still over a year away from being bottled, and it’s years away from its prime.

Despite the difficulty in determining the quality of a wine when it is so young, the experts use these first tastes to predict how good this wine will be when it matures. The wineries hang on these first expert predictions of quality. The predictions appear in wine guides and drive early demand. They influence the price of the early wine sales.

The economist Orley Ashenfelter proposed an alternative way to predict wine quality. A simple statistical model. There were only three inputs to his model - the temperature during the summer growing season, the previous winter’s rainfall, and the harvest rainfall. Ashenfelter circulated the predictions derived from his model in a newsletter to a small circle of wine lovers.

You can see in this story two contrasting ways of informing or making a decision - expert or human judgement in the first case and a model in the second. Which approach worked better?

Ashenfelter's model could predict more of the variation in vintage price than the expert judgements. This is despite the fact that those expert judgements affected the price. When Ashenfelter added weather information to the expert predictions, he improved them. To top it off, he didn’t even need to taste the wine. He could make predictions months before the experts.
