# 1.7 The principal-agent model

Principal-agent problems are a model of a game between two players, the principal and the agent, who face a conflict of interest. One class of principal-agent problems involves hidden actions, where the conflict between the principal and the agent is over an action that may be taken by the agent, and this action cannot be detailed in a complete contract. The agent knows what action is taken, but the principal doesn't.

In the case of an employer and employee, the employer is the principal and the employee the agent. The hidden action is the employee's effort. There is a problem because the employer would like the employee to work hard, whereas the employee would prefer to take it easy. 

Here we will use a principal-agent model to illustrate the trade-offs between risk sharing and incentives when effort cannot be completely monitored. It provides insight into the design of compensation plans.

Below are two examinations of a basic principal-agent model, one narrative and the other mathematical. You won't be asked to replicate the math, but you may find that it will assist your understanding of the scenario.

## A narrative exploration

Erica is another employee of Acme Corporation. Erica's output increases with her effort, but her output is also subject to other (random) effects outside of her control.

As for Ian, if Erica's effort could be observed, they could simply develop a contract under which she is paid by effort. But in Erica's case, they can't observe it.

Paying Erica a fixed salary is problematic. If her effort is not observable, Erica could put in low effort. Plus, Erica could blame the low output on bad luck (the effects outside of her control). 

An alternative is for the firm to observe and pay based on output. Suppose they pay Erica a fixed sum plus a share of the output she produces.

Since Erica's effort is costly, like Ian she will want to be compensated for this. She will set her effort level such that her expected compensation minus the cost of the effort is greatest. This is at the level of effort where the marginal benefit of increased compensation equals the marginal cost of additional effort.

Counter-intuitively, in setting her effort Erica does not need to take into account the effects on output that are out of her control if compensation goes up with every unit of effort. In that case, the marginal cost and benefit of effort are not affected by the random shocks that otherwise affect Erica's payment. A random effect that reduced output does not change the fact that extra effort increases output and, accordingly, Erica's compensation. (It does, however, have other effects that we will discuss later.)

Erica's optimal level of effort is also not linked to the fixed sum component of her compensation. The fixed sum does not affect the marginal benefit of effort. Higher pay does not provide an incentive in this model unless it is linked to performance.

Erica's effort does increase, however, with an increase if she is paid a higher proportion of her output. This increases the marginal benefit of her effort.

## A mathematical exploration

Assume that we have a risk neutral employer and a risk averse employee. Erica is an employee who has output given by the following:

$Q=\alpha e+\mu$

$\mu\sim(0,\sigma^2)$

where *Q* is the value of the output (which is observable); *e* is effort; $\alpha$ is her marginal productivity, and $\mu$ is some random effect.

If effort (*e*) could be observed, we might expect a contract that specifies a level of effort $\hat{e}$ for a fixed salary *W*.

That contract would deliver profit to the firm of:

$\pi=(\alpha e+\mu)-W$

But suppose neither *e* nor $\mu$ is observable.

In that case, as noted above, Erica may put in low effort or blame the low output on bad luck (a low $\mu$). 

We could instead provide an incentive to Erica by basing her compensation on output. Consider her effort problem if she is paid according to the following linear payment schedule:

$Compensation=W_0+\beta Q$    
$\:0\leq \beta \leq 1$

where $W_0$ is a fixed wage and $\beta$ is the proportion of output (*Q*) received. 

This type of contract might represent a typical compensation scheme. Let:

$W_0=1000$ and $\beta=0.2$

$Q=100e+\mu$

$C(e)=e^2$

where *C(e)* is Erica's cost of effort.

Then:

$Compensation=1000+0.2(100e+\mu) \\ =1000+20e+0.2\mu$

## Setting optimal effort

Solving this, Erica sets the level of effort where the compensation minus cost of effort is greatest. Note that an extra unit of effort always increases compensation by \$20. The random component or shock ($\mu$) affects the total level of payment, but not the marginal impact of effort. This means that the employee (Erica) can effectively ignore $\mu$. In this case the optimal choice of effort is equal to 10.

## Increasing the fixed wage

A change in $W_0$ doesn't change incentives around effort. With a higher intercept the optimal choice of effort is unchanged. What is important is the marginal benefit and marginal cost of effort.

## Increasing the share of output

A change in $\beta$ changes the optimal effort level. The optimal choice of effort is increased as the marginal benefit of effort is increased.
