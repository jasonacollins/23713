# 6.1 Group decision making: statistical versus deliberating groups

Much decision making in the corporate environment involves groups.

Group decisions are often better than individual decisions. Groups are often formed to achieve this better performance.

To analyse group decisions, we need to distinguish two different types of groups.

**Statistical groups** involve members giving their inputs individually. Those inputs are aggregated to make the forecast or decision. Voting is a simple example, which works well if the majority is right.

There is strong evidence that statistical groups make better decisions than individuals. The story of Francis Galton is a classic example. Galton had people [estimate the weight of an ox](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_Galton#Variance_and_standard_deviation). The average of the individual predictions was right on the mark.

**Deliberating groups** involve individuals providing input during deliberations. Those inputs can affect and be affected by the inputs of other group members. People aim to influence others. People might change their minds.

The evidence that deliberating groups improve decision making is mixed. Deliberating groups have the potential to arrive at the correct answer even when the majority have an incorrect belief at the beginning. But the converse is also possible.

In one experiment, people answered questions individually before answering those same questions in groups. If the majority of the group knew the correct answer to a problem, the group's decision was correct 79% of the time. (The incorrect minority were able to derail the group 21% of the time.) If the majority of the group answered a question incorrectly when answering individually, the group converged on the right answer only 44% of the time. The result of this dynamic was that the average group decision was better than majority voting, but only marginally so (66% versus 62%).
