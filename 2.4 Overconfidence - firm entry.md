# 2.4 Overconfidence - firm entry

Most new businesses fail within a few years. For example, one study of US manufacturers found over 60% of entrants had exited within five years and almost 80% within 10 years.

Colin Camerer and Dan Lovallo ran an experiment to test whether business failure may be due to optimism about their relative skill.

The lab experiment involved a set of markets in which market entrants were paid a set amount according to their rank within the market. Those ranked within the "market capacity" would share a payment of \$50. Those beyond the market capacity would be penalised \$10. Accordingly, if there are 5 entrants above market capacity, the expected payoff of all entrants is zero. More than that and it is negative.

The rank in the market was determined by either luck, through a random draw, or a test of skill involving logic puzzles or trivia questions about sports or current events.

In each round of the experiment, the market capacity was announced to the players, along with whether the payoffs in the market were based on luck or skill. The participants were then asked to forecast the expected number of entrants (for which they earn a payment if correct) and decide simultaneously and without communicating whether to enter into the market. Subjects were then told how many participants had entered.

After all of the rounds, students solved puzzles or took the trivia quiz to determine their skill rank.

The results of the experiment showed that more participants entered the market when the ranking was based on skill than if based on random draw. This indicates a belief that their skill level will rank them higher than a random draw: they are above average.

An interesting element to this experiment was that for some of the markets the participants were recruited by being asked if they would like to volunteer for an experiment in which performance would depend on their performance on sports or current event trivia questions. Hence the pool in those markets would be stronger than typical.

In those markets with self-selected participants, market entry was even higher, and payoffs were negative in most rounds. This suggests the self-selected entrants were overconfident in their skill due to what Camerer and Lovallo call "reference group neglect". The participants seem to neglect that the others in the reference group also self-selected in to the experiment and think they are skilled too.

What type of overconfidence might the market entrants by showing? Could Moore and Healy's model explain the behaviour in this experiment? 

Don Moore, John Oesch and Charlene Zietsma ran an experiment on firm entry and found, like Camerer and Lovallo, that entrepreneurs overweight personal factors and underweight competitors when making entry decisions. However, when they varied the task difficulty, they found excess entry only when the industry appeared an easy one in which to compete. When it appeared difficult, too few entered.
