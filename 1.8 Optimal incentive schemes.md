# 1.8 Optimal incentive schemes

Given this principle-agent problem, what should a firm do? It will try to maximise profit.

To do this, first it needs to ensure that the reservation level of utility is met, otherwise the individual will not work for the firm. One way to do this is to adjust $w_0$ (the base pay) to ensure this is the case.

Then it needs to induce effort. It will want to set $\beta$ at the right level. But this comes at a cost to the firm. With greater reward for effort we would expect that Erica will work harder - this should lead to higher payments for the firm. But with higher $\beta$ the risk that Erica is exposed to is increased. For a risk averse worker this will generally mean that Erica will need to be compensated more so that she is willing to bear the higher risk.

What does all this mean? The following five factors favour high incentive pay:

a) A strong relationship between the employee's effort and output, meaning the benefits of motivating effort are high    
b) The employee has low risk aversion, as a person with high risk aversion will require higher compensation to bear the risk    
c) A low level of risk that is beyond the control of the employee ($\sigma^2$), as output is then primarily a function of greater effort    
d) High sensitivity to increased incentives (e.g the cost of effort is not so high as to prevent a response to the incentive)    
e) The employee's output is measurable at low cost.
