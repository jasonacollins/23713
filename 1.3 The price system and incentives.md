# 1.3 The price system and incentives

Private property rights create the incentives for decentralised decision makers to act on their specific information. The wealth effects of the decision are borne by the resource owner.

In a centrally planned economy, a decision maker has limited or less direct incentives to act on their information as they do not own the resources they control. People under direction of those making decisions (i.e. bureaucrats) may have limited incentive to carry out instructions. Profits do not go to them, but to the state.

## Friedrich Hayek on the price system

In his famous paper [The Use of Knowledge in Society](https://www.jstor.org/stable/1809376), 1974 Nobel Memorial Prize winner Friedrich Hayek provides an illustration of the price system in action.

> Assume that somewhere in the world a new opportunity for the use of some raw material, say, tin, has arisen, or that one of the sources of supply of tin has been eliminated. It does not matter for our purpose — and it is very significant that it does not matter — which of these two causes has made tin more scarce. All that the users of tin need to know is that some of the tin they used to consume is now more profitably employed elsewhere and that, in consequence, they must economize tin. There is no need for the great majority of them even to know where the more urgent need has arisen, or in favor of what other needs they ought to husband the supply. If only some of them know directly of the new demand, and switch resources over to it, and if the people who are aware of the new gap thus created in turn fill it from still other sources, the effect will rapidly spread throughout the whole economic system and influence not only all the uses of tin but also those of its substitutes and the substitutes of these substitutes, the supply of all the things made of tin, and their substitutes, and so on; and all his without the great majority of those instrumental in bringing about these substitutions knowing anything at all about the original cause of these changes. The whole acts as one market, not because any of its members survey the whole field, but because their limited individual fields of vision sufficiently overlap so that through many intermediaries the relevant information is communicated to all. The mere fact that there is one price for any commodity — or rather that local prices are connected in a manner determined by the cost of transport, etc. — brings about the solution which (it is just conceptually possible) might have been arrived at by one single mind possessing all the information which is in fact dispersed among all the people involved in the process.

## So why firms?

If private ownership and market exchange trumps state control, why does organisation into a firm, which breaks down the price mechanism and private ownership, occur? It seems to be introducing the same problems suffered by a centralised state, with decisions by managers akin to central planning. Managers do not hold all of the specific information required to make decisions, nor do they hold direct property rights that enable them to capture the full value of their decisions.

Instead, why isn't all production and exchange done through market transactions between individuals?
