# 2.3 Overconfidence - a model

Don Moore and Paul Healy's explanation for this mix of over and underconfidence on tasks of varying difficulty is that, after performing a task, we have imperfect information about our own performance. We have even less perfect information about that of others.

The result of the imperfect information is that people's post-task assessments of their performance is regressive. That is, it tends to revert to the typical level of performance. Their perception of other's performance is even more regressive.

When performance is high, the regressive assessment leads people to underestimate their own performance, but underestimate others even more so. Hence, they overplace themselves. For tasks with low performance, they overestimate their performance, but overestimate others even more. Hence they underplace for hard tasks.

As an illustration, consider an easy task, such as a test in an easy university subject. Suppose you know that the average mark in past years for this subject was 70%, and you expect to get the same result.

You then take the test, and think you might have done really well. "Did I just get everything right on that test? I could have got as high as 90%."

However, you can't be sure that your impression is correct. There might have been a trick question. So it makes sense to update your belief to a score of more than 70%, but perhaps not all the way to 90%. Let's say the new estimate of our performance is 80%.

To the extent the new information is accurate (your score actually was 90%), you would be underestimating your performance.

But what of others? Before the test, you assumed they would get the same 70% as yourself. But you are now told that you scored 90%. Should you update the estimate of the other's performance?

That depends on what you attribute your higher score to. Partly, it was easier than you expected, so it would have been easy for them. But it must also have been partly due to some idiosyncratic feature of your performance on the day. Maybe you blitzed it?

The result is that you update their estimated performance up from 70%, but not all the way to the 90% that you scored.

The result of this adjustment is that your believe your performance is higher than others, a feature of overplacement.
