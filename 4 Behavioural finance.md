While the early days of the efficient markets hypothesis involved a parade of confirmatory studies, the last 30 years has seen a steady flow of theory and evidence that brings all three forms of the hypothesis into question. Recent studies have found many *anomalies*, empirical studies that bring market efficiency into question absent a better explanation.

Due to the joint hypothesis problem, "absent a better explanation" is a important qualifier. The tests of market efficiency are effectively a joint test of two hypotheses: market hypotheses and the particular model of risk used in the analysis. This means that any "anomaly" could be either evidence of market inefficiency or an inappropriate risk-adjustment technique.

The result is that every discovery of an anomaly is followed by a debate as to whether it is truly an anomaly and whether there is a rational explanation for it. That said, some anomalies have been hard to explain away.

In the remainder of this module we examine a series of anomalies. Three relate to anomalies concerning individual stocks: lagged reactions to events and announcements, momentum, and  value stock out-performance. Three concern aggregate stock market performance: the equity premium puzzle, bubbles and excessive volatility. Finally, we will close with an examination of trader performance.
