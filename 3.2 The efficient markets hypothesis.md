# 3.2 The efficient markets hypothesis

The efficient markets hypothesis states that, if markets are efficient, then asset prices should reflect all available information. As such, prices should reflect the fundamental value of the asset.

When Eugene Fama first labelled the efficient markets hypothesis in 1970, he proposed three forms of market efficiency:

- **The weak form**: Prices reflect all information contained in historical returns. That is, beyond today's price, knowing the price history of a security should be of no value in predicting the future price of that security.  
- **The semi-strong form**: Prices reflect all publicly available information. This includes past earnings, earnings forecasts, financial statements, stories in the media, economic conditions and anything else in the public domain that may be relevant.
- **The strong form**: Prices reflect all information, including that which is not publicly available. This includes private information held by insiders.

Practically, there is a cost to acquiring information, so the assumption that prices will always reflect *all* information is not reasonable. Therefore, a better working definition for the efficient market hypothesis is that prices reflect all information except that for which the marginal cost of acquiring the information exceeds the marginal benefit of acting on the information.

This last statement implies that, although there may be some information not yet incorporated into the price, no investor can generate excess returns.

The efficient markets hypothesis is largely examined and tested using data from exchanges. The high levels of liquidity and the transparency of prices and dividends allow minute examination of whether the price is efficient. Determining whether a market is efficient, however, is not an easy task.
