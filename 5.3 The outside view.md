# 5.3 The outside view

## Designing a textbook

Daniel Kahneman was involved in a project to develop a curriculum and textbook for a course in judgement and decision making. At the conclusion of a working session on the curriculum, Kahneman asked each of the participants in that session to write down how long they thought it would take to submit a draft of the textbook to the Department of Education.

Kahneman collected the estimates and wrote them on the board. All of the responses were between 18 and 30 months, a narrow band suggesting a couple of years of work to come.

Kahneman then asked the curriculum expert in the room about his past experience.

The expert started: “You know, I never realized this before, but in fact not all the teams at a stage comparable to ours ever did complete their task. A substantial fraction of the teams ended up failing to finish the job.”

Kahneman asked how large he estimated that fraction was.

The expert: “About 40%” 

Kahneman: “Those who finished, how long did it take them?”

The expert: “I cannot think of any group that finished in less than seven years,” he replied, “nor any that took more than ten.”

Kahneman again: “When you compare our skills and resources to those of the other groups, how good are we? How would you rank us in comparison with these teams?” 

“We’re below average,” he said, “but not by much.”

All of this came from someone who only moments earlier had estimated a time of similar magnitude as the rest of the group.

The textbook was ultimately delivered in 8 years and was never used.

## The inside versus the outside view

Contrast the two estimates of the time to complete the textbook.

First, we have an estimate of the time it would take from the perspective of those who know all of the details of the plan to develop the textbook. They have taken these details and turned them into an estimate. An estimate of this type - looking at the specifics of the case - is often called the inside view.

We also have a second estimate from the curriculum expert derived from other similar projects. It incorporated none of the specific details of this particular textbook. This is often called the outside view.

Contrasting the two, the inside view focuses on the specific circumstances and experiences, maybe with margin for caution. The outside view captures a bigger picture absent the detail. The inside view uses the specific information about the problem at hand. The outside view looks at whether there are similar situations - a reference class - that can provide a statistical basis for the judgement.

The problem with the inside view is that, while seemingly taking more into account, it effectively fails to account for unforeseen events that inevitably crop up during every project. There are many ways for plans to fail. Although most are improbable, the likelihood that something will go wrong in a big project is high. These problems are naturally contained in the outside view.

The result is that the outside view - ignoring the finer details of the project - can give us a better estimate.

## Reference class forecasting

One way of using the outside view is reference class forecasting. When making a forecast, don’t just look at the specific circumstances of the case. Ask if there is a broader *reference class* of events that you can look at to see how they turned out. Base your forecast on the outcomes of the reference class rather than your own specific forecast. Or if you believe your case has some unique features, start with your reference class forecast, and cautiously adjust from there for any unique features of your case.

The power of reference case forecasting in corporate decision settings is well established. For example, Dan Lovallo, Carmina Clarke and Colin Camerer (2012) examined private equity investment decisions and found that an outside view performed better than using a few analogies familiar to the decision maker.

Reference case forecasting can be particularly powerful in overcoming the planning fallacy. The planning fallacy is the tendency of people to underestimate the completion times and costs for difficult tasks (recall the circumstances where we are "overconfident"), even when they know that most similar tasks have run late or over-budget. An estimate based on a reference class can provide a check to the project estimate.

Bent Flyvbjerg (2006) catalogued the planning mistakes associated with large projects, such as IT and infrastructure builds. These projects consistently run over budget and over time, and are often based on overoptimistic assumptions of their value. For example, he had found rail cost forecasts were typically out by 44% for rail projects, 33% for bridges and tunnels and 20% for roads. Demand for rail projects is typically overestimated by 51%.

Using a database of major projects he developed, Flyvberg has access to an effective reference class with which to adjust cost estimates for major projects. This has now been used in decision making for projects such as the Edinburgh Tram and London's Crossrail project. 

## Failure to use the outside view

The failure of the curriculum expert to use the outside view initially in making an estimate of the time to complete the forecast was not an anomaly. There is ample evidence that people will ignore the outside view even when it is right in front of them.

Freymuth and Ronan (2004) asked experimental participants to select treatment for a fictitious disease. Participants were told the efficacy of two different treatments, plus given an anecdote of a patient outcome for each.

When the participants were able to choose a treatment with a 90% success rate that was paired with a positive anecdote, they chose it 90% of the time (choosing a control treatment with 50% efficacy the remaining 10% of the time). But when paired with a negative anecdote, only 39% chose the 90% efficacy treatment. Similarly, a treatment with 30% efficacy paired with a negative anecdote was chosen only 7% of the time, but this increased to 78% when it was paired with a positive anecdote. The stories drowned out the base rate information.

## The outside view and reference case forecasting as a model

The outside view and reference case forecasting are simple examples of models. The variable that is input into the model is the reference class outcome, such as the mean time to completion of similar projects or the average cost overrun. In the simplest case, there is no mathematical transformation of that input: the output, such as the estimation of the time to completion of your project, simply equals the input.
